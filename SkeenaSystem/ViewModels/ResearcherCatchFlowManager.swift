// ResearcherCatchFlowManager.swift — Step-by-step confirmation flow for researcher catch recording.
//
// Encapsulates the researcher-specific conversational flow:
//   1. Identification — confirm species, lifecycle, sex (and location context)
//   2. Measurements  — show length/girth/weight calculated with confirmed species
//   3. Length confirmation
//   4. Girth confirmation
//   5. Final summary
//   6. Voice memo
//
// Species must be confirmed BEFORE measurements are shown, because the weight
// formula divisor depends on the species + river combination.
// Weight is always derived (never confirmed separately).
// Owned by CatchChatViewModel; only instantiated when the user role is .researcher.
