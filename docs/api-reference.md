# Mad Thinker Platform API Reference

**Version:** 2026-05-01
**Generated:** 2026-05-11T09:01:54.196Z

## Key Concepts

- **member_id**: UUID foreign key reference to a member record
- **member_number**: Human-readable string identifier in MAD Crockford Base32 format — 9 characters: "MAD" prefix + 6 random characters from 0-9 A-H J-N P-T V-Z (e.g., "MAD4ZQ7H9")
- **Entitlements**: Per-community-type feature toggles with E_ prefix (e.g., E_CATCH_CAROUSEL). Note: E_THE_BUZZ has been removed.
- **Add-ons**: Per-community feature toggles (OPS, Sales, Social) stored in the community_addons table. The "Social" add-on replaces the former E_THE_BUZZ entitlement. CRM/member management is a core feature, not an add-on.
- **Roles**: community-scoped roles — angler, guide, admin, public, researcher
- **Units**: community-level setting — "imperial" or "metric"
- All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `apikey: <anon_key>` headers unless noted.

## Leave Community

## Manage Community

| display_name | string | ❌ | Display name |
| geography | object | ❌ | Geography config (rivers/water bodies) |
| learn_url | string | ❌ | DEPRECATED — use custom_urls. Mirrors first custom_urls entry for legacy clients. |
| custom_urls | array | ❌ | Up to 5 named links: [{ name: string (≤100), url: string (≤2048) }, ...]. Empty array clears. |
| units | string | ❌ | 'imperial' or 'metric' |
| donation_url | string | ❌ | Optional single donation URL (≤2048 chars). Pair with donation_description. Send empty string or null to clear. |
| donation_description | string | ❌ | Optional description for the donation link (≤500 chars). When donation_url is set, this should be populated to describe the cause/purpose. |

**Notes:**

- Response includes is_active: false for inactive communities; app must handle this state.
- custom_urls replaces the single learn_url. Mobile apps should render the array as a list of named links (e.g. on a community profile/learn screen). learn_url remains populated with the first entry's URL for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future release.
- Validation: max 5 entries, each entry requires non-empty name (≤100 chars) and url (≤2048 chars). Violations return 400.
- donation_url and donation_description are optional. When donation_url is populated, the configuration package returned to clients will include both fields so apps can render a 'Donate' link with a description. If donation_url is empty/null, both fields will be null.
