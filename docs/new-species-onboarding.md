# New Species Onboarding — iOS Playbook

When the ML training pipeline ships a newly retrained `ViTFishSpecies.mlpackage` with an added class, these are the iOS steps to integrate it cleanly. Every step is mechanical — no judgment calls once the model is delivered.

This is the human-readable reference. The matching slash command is `.claude/commands/new-species.md` (keep it in sync when this doc changes).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, confirm with the ML agent that all of the following are true:

- [ ] `~/dev/MadThinkerML/models/ViTFishSpecies.mlpackage` was regenerated with the new class.
- [ ] `~/dev/MadThinkerML/models/LengthRegressor.mlmodel` was **retrained against the new class indices**. This is not optional — indices shift when a species is inserted (see "Index shift cascade" below) and the regressor will silently produce wrong-distribution predictions if it isn't aligned.
- [ ] The ML agent reported validation metrics. If the new class has val accuracy < 70% or fewer than ~100 training images, flag it as a weak class in the commit message.
- [ ] You know **exactly** where the new label falls in Python `ImageFolder` alphabetical order. This determines its index — the label is not appended to the end of the list.

If any of these are false, **stop**. Updating app code against a half-baked model produces silent misclassification.

## Branch setup

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b species-<new-class>-expansion   # e.g. species-coho-salmon-expansion
```

Don't commit to main until after local sim verification.

## Step 1 — Copy the model artifacts

`.mlpackage` is a directory bundle, not a file. Use `cp -R` and remove the old package first to avoid stale files surviving the copy:

```bash
rm -rf SkeenaSystem/Models/ViTFishSpecies.mlpackage
cp -R  ~/dev/MadThinkerML/models/ViTFishSpecies.mlpackage SkeenaSystem/Models/
cp     ~/dev/MadThinkerML/models/LengthRegressor.mlmodel  SkeenaSystem/Models/
```

**Don't commit** `.mlmodelc` files — those are build artifacts Xcode compiles from `.mlpackage` on first build. `.gitignore` should already cover them.

The project uses Xcode 16 file-system-synchronized groups, so dropping files into `SkeenaSystem/Models/` auto-registers them with the app target. Verify in Xcode that both files appear under `SkeenaSystem/Models/` in the navigator AND in the target's "Copy Bundle Resources" phase.

## Step 2 — Update `speciesLabels`

File: [`SkeenaSystem/Managers/CatchPhotoAnalyzer.swift`](../SkeenaSystem/Managers/CatchPhotoAnalyzer.swift) — search for `private let speciesLabels`.

Insert the new label in its **alphabetical position** (matching Python `ImageFolder` order). Example — adding `coho_salmon` to the current 5-class list:

```swift
private let speciesLabels: [String] = [
    "atlantic_salmon",
    "coho_salmon",         // NEW — alphabetically between atlantic and other
    "other",
    "sea_run_trout",
    "steelhead_holding",
    "steelhead_traveler"
]
```

### Lifecycle-stage gotcha

If the label uses the `<species>_<lifecycle>` pattern (like `steelhead_holding`), confirm the lifecycle suffix is `holding` or `traveler` — `splitSpecies()` in `CatchChatViewModel.swift` only parses those two trailing words. Any other suffix will fail to split correctly. Update `splitSpecies()` if you need a new stage.

## Step 3 — Update `regressorBypassSpecies`

Same file. There are **two occurrences** (one in `analyze()`, one in `reEstimateLength()`) — use `replace_all` on the edit.

Bypass the new species from the CoreML length regressor until it has calibrated ground-truth length data. Until real catches with measured lengths exist for the new species, the regressor will extrapolate wildly.

```swift
// Was:
let regressorBypassSpecies: Set<String> = ["sea_run_trout", "other", "atlantic_salmon"]
// Now:
let regressorBypassSpecies: Set<String> = ["sea_run_trout", "other", "atlantic_salmon", "coho_salmon"]
```

Remove a species from this set in a future round **only** after you have enough real catches with measured lengths to fit a species-specific range in `speciesLengthRanges` (see Step 5).

## Step 4 — Update `speciesDisplayNames`

File: [`SkeenaSystem/ViewModels/CatchChatViewModel.swift`](../SkeenaSystem/ViewModels/CatchChatViewModel.swift) — search for `private static let speciesDisplayNames`.

The key is the **lowercased, underscore-stripped** species prefix (lifecycle stage dropped). The value is the user-facing display name shown in the chat and on catch reports.

```swift
private static let speciesDisplayNames: [String: String] = [
    "atlantic salmon": "Atlantic Salmon",
    "coho salmon":     "Coho Salmon",     // NEW
    "sea run trout":   "Sea-Run Trout",
    "steelhead":       "Steelhead",
    "other":           "Bi-catch",
]
```

Missing keys fall back to `valueOnly.capitalized`, which produces `"Coho Salmon"` anyway. The explicit entry is still useful for stylization (hyphens, title case, etc.) and as a contract declaration.

## Step 5 — `speciesLengthRanges` (usually leave alone)

Same file as Step 2 (`CatchPhotoAnalyzer.swift`). This dict holds calibrated min/max length ranges per species for the heuristic fallback.

- **Don't add** the new species here until you have calibrated length data. Both call sites use `if let range = Self.speciesLengthRanges[species]` — missing keys cleanly fall to the default steelhead-range clamp, which is what the bypass list ensures anyway.
- Add an entry only when you have real catch data to fit it.

## Step 6 — Build + simulator verification

```bash
xcodebuild -workspace SkeenaSystem.xcworkspace \
  -scheme SkeenaSystem \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  build
```

If you hit cache issues, `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SkeenaSystem-*` and rebuild.

Then on the sim, run through this checklist:

| Input | Expected species | Expected length source | Expected display |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Known steelhead photo | `steelhead_holding` or `steelhead_traveler`, high confidence | CoreML regressor | "Steelhead" |
| Photo of the new class | The new label, moderate-to-high confidence | **Heuristic** (bypass) | Display name from Step 4 |
| OOD / exotic fish | `other` | **Heuristic** (bypass) | "Bi-catch" |

For the bypass confirmation, search Console for the log line `Using species-scaled heuristic for <species> (regressor not yet calibrated)` — that's emitted from the bypass branch.

**Regression check:** a known steelhead photo must still predict `steelhead_*` correctly. If it now predicts something else, the model package didn't take — re-check Step 1.

## Step 7 — Commit, merge, clean up

Once sim checks pass:

```bash
# Include the model artifacts — weight.bin and model.mlmodel will show as modified.
git add SkeenaSystem/Managers/CatchPhotoAnalyzer.swift \
        SkeenaSystem/ViewModels/CatchChatViewModel.swift \
        SkeenaSystem/Models/LengthRegressor.mlmodel \
        SkeenaSystem/Models/ViTFishSpecies.mlpackage

git commit -m "Expand ViTFishSpecies — add <new_species>"
git push -u origin species-<new-class>-expansion

# After review / user sign-off:
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only species-<new-class>-expansion
git push
git branch -d species-<new-class>-expansion
git push origin --delete species-<new-class>-expansion
```

Include in the commit message:
- Which classes shifted indices (every class alphabetically after the new one)
- Val accuracy of the new class, and training image count if weak
- Whether the new class is in `regressorBypassSpecies`

## Index shift cascade — why the regressor retrain is non-optional

`speciesLabels` must match Python `ImageFolder` alphabetical order exactly, and `speciesIndex` is a feature the LengthRegressor uses. Inserting a species alphabetically shifts every subsequent index by +1.

Concrete example — adding `chinook_salmon` to the current 5 classes:

```
Before:                     After:
0: atlantic_salmon         0: atlantic_salmon
1: other                   1: chinook_salmon   ← NEW
2: sea_run_trout           2: other            ← shifted +1
3: steelhead_holding       3: sea_run_trout    ← shifted +1
4: steelhead_traveler      4: steelhead_holding ← shifted +1
                           5: steelhead_traveler ← shifted +1
```

If the LengthRegressor was trained against the old indices, every species now sends a stale index in — the regressor treats `sea_run_trout` inputs as if they were `other`, and so on. The regressor doesn't error; it just quietly produces wrong-distribution predictions.

**Always retrain the LengthRegressor alongside ViT.** If the ML agent ships only a new `.mlpackage` without a new `.mlmodel`, push back before merging.

## Known landmines

- **Preprocessing norms.** `runViT` passes `mean: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]` (Inception-style, timm's default for `vit_tiny_patch16_224`) — not ImageNet. This is already correct in `CatchPhotoAnalyzer.swift` and you shouldn't need to change it, but don't revert it either. Matching training preprocessing is load-bearing; feeding ImageNet-normalized inputs to an Inception-trained model produces silent garbage.
- **Confidence threshold.** `SPECIES_DETECTION_THRESHOLD` in xcconfig (`DevTEST.xcconfig` / `PROD.xcconfig`) gates when the model's top prediction is trusted vs. when we fall back to "Species: Unable to confidently detect". Tune via xcconfig, not in code.
- **Don't touch `splitSpecies()` lifecycle parsing.** It only recognizes `holding` and `traveler`. Any other trailing word will be treated as part of the species name.
- **Bi-catch UX.** The `other` class gets special treatment — `"Bi-catch"` display name, `Sex: -` override, and a custom tail message in the researcher flow prompting the user to name the actual species. Preserve this behavior. See `beginResearcherFlow` in `CatchChatViewModel.swift` and `identificationPrompt()` / `identificationSummary()` in `ResearcherCatchFlowManager.swift`.
- **Never add `MediaPipeTasksVision` to the test target.** Duplicate-symbol crashes. The test target gets headers via search paths only.
